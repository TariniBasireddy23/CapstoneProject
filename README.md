# Predicting Sleep Apnea and Insomnia
## What are Sleep Disorders?
Sleep disorders are a group of conditions that affect the quality, quantity, or duration of sleep that a person experiences, leading to negative consequences such as excessive daytime sleepiness, poor concentration, poor memory, and health problems. Two sleep disorders of particular interest are Insomnia and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) given their nationwide prevalence. 

In this project, I explore a publicly-available dataset containing 374 simulated records of patients with no sleep disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, or insomnia. The dataset details 15 lifestyle, health, and cardiovascular metrics for each patient.

This github repository contains my code as a .ipynb file, the dataset as a .csv file, and my final report as a .pdf file.
